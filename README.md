## 💻 Development Transparency

**Important Note:** This theme was developed exclusively using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (an AI-powered code editor) with paid subscription. I am not a programmer by profession—I'm a System Administrator with a passion for sharing knowledge through blogging.

The development process involved:
- Iterative conversations with Cursor's AI assistant
- Learning and understanding code through AI explanations
- Testing and refining features with AI guidance
- Building on the excellent foundation of astro-erudite

This transparency is important because:
1. **Honesty** - You should know how this theme was created
2. **Accessibility** - It demonstrates that you don't need to be a professional developer to create useful tools
3. **AI-Assisted Development** - Shows the potential of AI coding assistants for non-programmers

While the code was written with AI assistance, all decisions about features, design, and implementation were made by me based on my needs as a blogger. The theme has been tested and is fully functional.
